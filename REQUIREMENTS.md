# EAG Math App

## Goal:
I want to teach my kid addition and subtraction. He is 4 years old.

I want to build an app that works in the browser using the canvas or webGL technology

## Requirements

I want the app to work on phone browsers, in both portrait and non-portrait mode.

It should show a character like a bunny jump on a number line. The number line should contain starting number and ending numbers. For instance in order to teach summation, it should show two numbers like 4 + 3, show some numbers before 4, then 4, where the bunny starts, the number should be a different color. Then the bunny should jump to 5 which turns red, then to 6 which turns red, and then stops at 7 which turns red. The numbers the bunny is not at should all be black.

I want to be able to press next after each animation to go to the next example. The examples should be randomly generated so we can practice. It should keep a history of the examples so we can go back and forth. 

The app should not show the answer to the user initially. It should allow each number to be clickable.
It should wait for the user to click a number on the number line, and it should be considered their answer. Afger that the bunny should hop one number at a time to the chosen answer. If the answer is correct, it will dance, otherwise it will be sad. Happy music should play if answer is correct, otherwise a sad sound. It will then wait for the user to choose the next answer. The bunny can hop to the next chosen answer, and be happy and dance if the answer is correct, otherwise be sad and make a sad sound. 
Continue doing that until the user presses next and goes to the next questino.

I also want to limit the examples to only be within 1 - 10. So the answers all fall within single digita. I have updated the examples to be like that also. 

## Examples
4 + 3 = 7
6 + 3 = 9
5 - 3 = 2
9 - 7 = 2

## Mocks
Use the Mock1 and Mock2 png files in this folder as an inspiration.
